This project focuses on building a personalized Movie Recommendation System to enhance user experience by suggesting movies based on their preferences. The system will utilize Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, or a Hybrid Approach for generating recommendations. Data will be collected from sources like IMDb or TMDb and preprocessed for analysis. The project will feature user authentication, search filters, and a dashboard displaying recommended movies, ratings, and reviews.
